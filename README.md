# Video-ke

## Overview ##

> Video-ke is a dual video player application with crossfading between players that obtains videos from Youtube.

![alt tag](https://github.com/dafabulousteach/Video-oke/appScreenShot.png)

> Video-ke was inspired by working with the codebase for TRNTBL3000, an music player app that allowed crossfading across two playlists. Video-ke incorporates crossfading but adds video functionality and the ability to search the Youtube API to add the songs you want to sing or listen to and use a crossfader in between songs.

## Integrated Technologies ##

> Youtube API v3

> JQuery, JQuery Slider

> Bootstrap, Bootstrap Slider UI

> Express.js

> Node.js
